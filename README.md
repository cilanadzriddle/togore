# togore
My first ever coding project! `togore` is a terminal user interface (TUI) timer tool with Pomodoro capabilities using Python and the Textual library.
# Installation
Clone this repository... and download the libraries... sorry.
# Usage
Use `python` to compile the application. `togore` uses the `argparse` library, so make sure to add the necessary arguments. `-t` is required for the program to run.
## Arguments

| Flag | Description              |
|------+--------------------------|
| -s   | Work seconds             |
| -m   | Work minutes             |
| -r   | Work hours               |
| -S   | Rest seconds             |
| -M   | Rest minutes             |
| -R   | Rest hours               |
| -c   | Number of cycles         |
| -t   | Title of task (required) |
## Example usage
